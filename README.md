# Car-Exhibit-replica-using-java-swing
I have created a car exhibition museum website's replica using java swing. The application showcases my proficiency in Java Swing for building interactive and user-friendly graphical interfaces. It consist of a landing page, a page for boooking tickets and is also integrated with SQL locally to store the details of the customer who bought the tickets.
